# Linux Text Editors Cheat Sheet

A cheat sheet to remember how to work with ed, vi, vim, nano, emacs, and micro in a short time. 

## Notice

I believe that vim is great, and I'm using it almost for every text editing or programming task nowadays. So, it might take a while to update other editors. However, I'm still very excited to learn emacs.
